After graduating from <a href="https://www.dal.ca">Dalhousie University</a> with a Bachelors of Science degree in Neuroscience, I moved to South Korea to teach English. After teaching for two years, I decided to come back to school to upgrade my degree to honours.

This year (Fall 2020), I enrolled in a Neural Data Science course to challenge myself to learn a new language: **Coding**. This portfolio showcases my acquired skills and different samples of work I have completed in the course.

## Completed Projects 💻
The following projects were written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). Click on the project to see the full analysis and code.
>
> ### Creating a DataFrame from a Dictionary
>> Here is an example of a code I wrote to [create a DataFrame](Provinces1.md) from a dictionary I made using different online resources.
>
> ### Visualizing a DataFrame
>> Here is an example of a code I wrote to [visualize the data](covidinprov1.md) from the above [example](Provinces1.md).
>
> ### Cleaning Raw Data
>> Here is an example of a code I wrote to [clean a raw data file](cleaningdata.md). This is important to do prior to performing Exploratory Data Analysis. 
>
> ### The Importance of Hand-washing 
>> [Here](handwashing.html), I used pandas and Matplotlib to analyze medical data and to show how essential hand-washing is.
>
> ### Flanker-Simon Study
>> In the following [project](noaproject1.html), I worked with a team to analyze behavioural data from an experiment that was ran in Dr. Aaron Newman's [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://www.ncilab.ca/) at Dalhousie University. We wanted to see if, in the study, there was an interaction between two well-known effects: the  flanker and the Simon task.
