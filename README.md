After graduating from <a href="https://www.dal.ca">Dalhousie University</a> with a Bachelors of Science degree in Neuroscience, I moved to South Korea to teach English. After teaching for two years, I decided to come back to school to upgrade my degree to honours.

This year (Fall 2020), I enrolled in a Neural Data Science course to challenge myself to learn a new language: **Coding**. This portfolio showcases my acquired skills and different samples of work I have completed in the course.
