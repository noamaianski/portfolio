After graduating from <a href="https://www.dal.ca">Dalhousie University</a> with a Bachelors of Science degree in Neuroscience, I moved to South Korea to teach English. After teaching for two years, I decided to come back to school to upgrade my degree to honours.

This year (Fall 2020), I enrolled in a Neural Data Science course to challenge myself to learn a new language: **Coding**. This portfolio showcases my acquired skills and different samples of work I have completed in the course.

## Completed Projects 💻
The following projects were written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). Click on the project to see the full analysis and code.
>
> ### Creating a DataFrame from a Dictionary
>> Here is an example of a code I wrote to [create a DataFrame](Provinces1.md) from a dictionary I made using different online resources.
>
> ### The Importance of Hand-washing 
>> [Here](handwashing.html), I used pandas and Matplotlib to analyze medical data and to show how essential hand-washing is.
>
> ### Flanker-Simon Study
>> In the following [project](noaproject1.html), I worked with a team to analyze behavioural data from an experiment that was ran in Dr. Aaron Newman's [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://www.ncilab.ca/) at Dalhousie University. We wanted to see if, in the study, there was an interaction between two well-known effects: the  flanker and the Simon task.
>
> ### Working with EEG Data: the N400
>> In this [project](project2.html), I worked with a team to study EEG data (collected from an experiment conducted in Dr. Aaron Newman's [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://www.ncilab.ca/)). Together, we were able to visualize ERP Waveforms and Topographic maps. 
>
> ### Analyzing and Visualizing Nobel Prize Winners
>> [Here](nobel.html), I worked with and visualized data from a CSV file found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates). Data here is of Nobel Prize winners from 1901-2016. In the code, you can see how I applied my pandas, seaborn, and numpy skills.
