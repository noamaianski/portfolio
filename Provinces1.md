## Creating a DataFrame from a Dictionary
#### Below is a dictionary I made of the provinces of Canada, their respective capital city, their total area (sum of land area and internal water area; in square kilometres), their population (from 2016), and the count of active cases of COVID-19 as of October 31, 2020. 
##### Note: the data was taken from the Government of Canada's website and Wikipedia. 


```python
dict = {
	"Province":["Alberta", "British Columbia", "Manitoba", "New Brunswick", "Newfoundland and Labrador", "Nova Scotia", "Ontario", "Prince Edward Island", "Quebec", "Saskatchewan"],
	"Capital":["Edmonton", "Victoria", "Winnipeg", "Fredericton", "St. John's", "Halifax", "Toronto", "Charlottetown", "Québec City", "Regina"],
	"Area":[661848, 944735, 647797, 72908, 405212, 55284, 1076395, 5660, 1542056, 651036],
	"Population": [4067175, 4648055, 1278365, 747101, 519716, 923598, 13448494, 142907, 8164361, 1098352],
	"Active cases": [5172, 2448, 3010, 38, 3, 11, 7877, 0, 9194, 739] }

```

#### It's difficult to understand the data in this format, so I used the below code to convert the dictionary into a DataFrame, with the index set as the names of the provinces.


```python
import pandas as pd
province = pd.DataFrame(dict)
```


```python
province.index=province["Province"]
del province["Province"]
```


```python
print(province)
```
